  Creates the folder and file for a specific date.

- `mydocs publish`  
  Updates (or creates) a `home.md` index file in the root with links to all journal entries.

---

## 📁 Folder/File Structure

When running `mydocs new`:

```
.
├── 2025-08-04/
│   └── Monday.md       # with title "# Monday, August 4, 2025"
├── 2025-08-05/
│   └── Tuesday.md
├── home.md             # generated by `mydocs publish`
```

---

## 🛠 Commands & Behavior

### 1. `mydocs new`

Creates today's journal folder and file.

```bash
mydocs new
```

- Creates folder: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Creates file: `DayOfWeek.md`
- Writes first line as:  
  `# DayOfWeek, Month Day, Year`

**Example:**

```bash
mydocs new
```

Creates:

```
2025-08-04/Monday.md
```

With content:

```md
# Monday, August 4, 2025
```

---

### 2. `mydocs new YYYY-MM-DD`

Creates journal for a custom date.

```bash
mydocs new 2025-12-25
```

Creates:

```
2025-12-25/Thursday.md
```

With:

```md
# Thursday, December 25, 2025
```

---

### 🛑 Duplication Check

If folder or file already exists, the command will:

- Output a message like:  
  `File 2025-08-04/Monday.md already exists. Aborting.`
- Exit without modifying anything.

---

### 3. `mydocs publish`

Scans current directory for folders in format `YYYY-MM-DD`, and:

- Checks for `home.md` in the current directory.
- For each found entry, checks if the reference exists in `home.md`.
- If not, appends the new entry as a Markdown link in **descending date order**.

**Example home.md entries:**

```md
- [2025-08-04/Monday](2025-08-04/Monday.md)
- [2025-08-03/Sunday](2025-08-03/Sunday.md)
```

- Only relative links are used (no full paths).
- Duplicate entries are avoided.

---

## 🆘 Help Command

The CLI should support a `help` command and/or display usage instructions when:

- The user types `mydocs help`
- The user passes no arguments
- The user passes invalid arguments

**Example Output:**

```
mydocs - Simple Markdown Journal CLI

Usage:
  mydocs new               Create journal entry for today
  mydocs new YYYY-MM-DD    Create journal entry for a specific date
  mydocs publish           Update home.md with links to all journal entries
  mydocs help              Show this help message
```

## 📌 Development Best Practices

- Use Go’s `os`, `time`, `path/filepath`, and `fmt` packages.
- Follow idiomatic Go patterns (error handling, small functions, etc).
- Use `time.Parse()` and `time.Format()` for date processing.
- Keep logic modular:  
  e.g. `createEntry()`, `checkExists()`, `updateHome()`.

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (optional)

- Add tags or metadata to each `.md` file.
- Automatically open created file in default editor.
- Add command to delete an entry.
- Format `home.md` as a table or with sections per month/year.
